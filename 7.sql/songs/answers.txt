I consider the calculation of the aura to be somewhat misguided, as it only takes into account the top 100 songs throughout the year and doesn't consider emotional variations over that period. For a better representation, we should increase the number of songs and observe the user's emotional states, as well as monitor which songs are listened to over a longer period of time. Another point is related to the increase in parameters, such as the variability of songs a user listens to, because eclectic people tend to have a more diverse aura.
